<p>Nihilism. It engulfs my brain once again, as did it this season yesteryear, as did it the year before.</p>
<p>I am thankful to neurology for separating happiness and unhappiness; I doubt I will stay happy for any longer that a day at a time, but at least I will not be unhappy.
  The dull emotional life that I live only flourishes in moments of sadness or fear. And that seems to happen while consuming the dopamine overdosing entertainment media we call films.
  Catch me with a genuine laughter at your well thought out joke, and you'd be a rare breed.</p>
  <p>Though I may have deceived you into thinking I am resentful to whomever is responsible for my existence, I am not, I am merely dissatisfied.</p>
  <p>I, however, will not be refunding the gift of breathing any time soon. Not intentionally anyways.</p>

<p>Today while riding home, I thought about how many weeks are in a year, and I remember being taught that the number is 52. Then I thought about 365 not being divisible by 7.
So you end up with 52 and a bit; 52.14 to be slightly more precise. Then I wanted to know exactly, so I grabbed my calculator and typed it in.
52.142857142857142857142857142857 according to my computer, But it is basically 52 weeks and 1 day.</p>
<p>Now there is the issue of leap years, now there is 366 days in the year. Which means the number becomes 52.285714285714285714285714285714 so only the first 2 deciamls disappear.
Tough all this means is that a leap year is 52 weeks and 2 days.
<p>This is all very common knowledge, I think most people know that a year is 52 weeks and 1 day. However this way of thinking made me unbderstand the world a little more than I
  did yesterday.</p>
  <p> </p>
<p>p.s. 1 day is roughly 14.2857% of the week. Hence why those are the decimal numbers.</p>
