  <h2>Meaning</h2>
  <p>Does a tree have meaning? And if so, what is its meaning?</p>
  <p>How about a giraffe? Or maybe an ape?</p>
<p>Do you believe people differ enough from trees, giraffes, or apes to have a different meaning?</p>
  <p>How so?</p>
  <p>Who decides what our meaning is, what force governs the existence of meaning?</p>
<p>If there is a greater force to which we owe our meaning, how different, to this being, are we from a tree?
Are we more deserving of meaning than our planetary kin? Are humans special in the scope of everything?</p>
<p>If so, is our meaning objective? If so; we all share a unified meaning, so then to look for individual meaning would be the same as looking towards the meaning of humanity. 
  So then look to your neighbour and try to find what you have in common, and find his neighbour, and his, and so forth, and find that which we all have or could have in common,
  in ideas or goals. That should be our meaning.</p>
<p>Is meaning subjective? Who then governs over this meaning? Who decides or creates this meaning? Is it an external force? 
  If so, I refer to my earlier statement about how an external force would see trees, or apes as different enough to make the exception to us humans to give us meaning and 
  deny that of a tree. Or if they do have meaning why ours would be any different?
  And if you then were to answer that the external force decides a different meaning for all thing and beings, and then proceeds to withhold that information, 
  then, obviously, it does not what you to find out about it.</p>
<p>Now if it is not an external force then that should mean it is yourself whom decides your own meaning. 
  Which means that you govern your own fulfilment of the meaning if you believe in free will. If not, then it goes back to being an external force, 
  whether it be society, kin or the supernatural. Which the n brings up the same questions as previously stated.</p>

    <p>I think our meaning is the same as that of a tree.</p>

<p>Nihilism. It engulfs my brain once again, as did it this season yesteryear, as did it the year before.</p>
<p>I am thankful to neurology for separating happiness and unhappiness; I doubt I will stay happy for any longer that a day at a time, but at least I will not be unhappy.
  The dull emotional life that I live only flourishes in moments of sadness or fear. And that seems to happen while consuming the dopamine overdosing entertainment media we call films.
  Catch me with a genuine laughter at your well thought out joke, and you'd be a rare breed.</p>
  <p>Though I may have deceived you into thinking I am resentful to whomever is responsible for my existence, I am not, I am merely dissatisfied.</p>
  <p>I, however, will not be refunding the gift of breathing any time soon. Not intentionally anyways.</p>

  
<h2>11/11/2020</h2>
<p>Today while riding home, I thought about how many weeks are in a year, and I remember being taught that the number is 52. Then I thought about 365 not being divisible by 7.
So you end up with 52 and a bit; 52.14 to be slightly more precise. Then I wanted to know exactly, so I grabbed my calculator and typed it in.
52.142857142857142857142857142857 according to my computer, But it is basically 52 weeks and 1 day.</p>
<p>Now there is the issue of leap years, now there is 366 days in the year. Which means the number becomes 52.285714285714285714285714285714 so only the first 2 deciamls disappear.
Tough all this means is that a leap year is 52 weeks and 2 days.
<p>This is all very common knowledge, I think most people know that a year is 52 weeks and 1 day. However this way of thinking made me unbderstand the world a little more than I
  did yesterday.</p>
  <p> </p>
<p>p.s. 1 day is roughly 14.2857% of the week. Hence why those are the decimal numbers.</p>

<p>Here is to my first post. Will try to post whenever I can to help get my thoughts in order.</p>
