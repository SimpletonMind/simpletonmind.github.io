<p>Today while riding home, I thought about how many weeks are in a year, and I remember being taught that the number is 52. Then I thought about 365 not being divisible by 7.
So you end up with 52 and a bit; 52.14 to be slightly more precise. Then I wanted to know exactly, so I grabbed my calculator and typed it in.</p>
<p>52.142857142857142857142857142857 according to my computer, But it is basically 52 weeks and 1 day.</p>
<p>Now there is the issue of leap years, now there is 366 days in the year. Which means the number becomes 52.285714285714285714285714285714 so only the first 2 deciamls disappear.
Tough all this means is that a leap year is 52 weeks and 2 days.
<p>This is all very common knowledge, I think most people know that a year is 52 weeks and 1 day. However this way of thinking made me unbderstand the world a little more than I
  did yesterday.</p>
<p>
p.s. 1 day is roughly 14.2857% of the week. Hence why those are the decimal numbers.</p>
